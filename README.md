# React Tests

These are some basic React and Redux examples for my learning purposes.

This currently has:

 - React
 - Redux
 - Authentication with JWT
 - Routes


The server side endpoint is this [project](https://github.com/AndrewSinclair/FoodMenuApplication) but I might change that in the near future, since that is actually an endpoint for another project.

## Installation:

    $ npm install


## Running Dev webpack server:

    $ npm start
